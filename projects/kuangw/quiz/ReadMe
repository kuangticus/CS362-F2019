In the folder you will find the testme.c file and makefile.

In the make file there are the following options:

make randomtest (or just 'make' that the same thing): 
this will make the executable in the name of randomtest without gcov flag in this mode
the newly generated executable will be ran as well.

make cCompile:
This will compile the program with the gcov flags and the executable will be named
coveragetest. The new generated executable will be ran as well in this mode.

make coverage:
This mode will run gcov with testme.c after the program has been ran at least once and
return the branch coverage.

clean:
This mode will clean everything that is generated from the make file.
